          <h1>Impossible- James Arthur</h1>
          <div class="para1">
            <p>I remember, years ago
                Someone told me I should take
                Caution when it comes to love, I did
                And you were strong and I was not
                My illusion, my mistake
                I was careless, I forgot, I did
                And now
                When all is done, there is nothing to say
                You have gone and so effortlessly
                You have won, you can go ahead, tell them</p>
          </div>
          <div class="para2">
            <p>Tell them all I know now
                Shout it from the rooftops
                Write it on the skyline
                All we had is gone now
                Tell them I was happy
                And my heart is broken
                All my scars are open
                Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
                Impossible
                Impossible
                Impossible</p>
          </div>

          <div class="para3">
            <p>Falling out of love is hard
                Falling for betrayal is worse
                Broken trust and broken hearts
                I know, I know
                And thinking all you need is there
                Building faith on love and words
                Empty promises will wear
                I know
                I know and now
                When all is done, there is nothing to say
                And if you're done with embarrassing me
                On your own, you can go ahead, tell them</p>
